<p> Moving to another country is an exciting, difficult and complex experience. 
In addition to the main issues, such as adapting to a new culture, learning a new language, 
understanding the way of life, there are several factors that can help or hinder the absorption process. </p>

<p>One of the most important points is to build your new network.
In our country, we often do not realize the importance of personal and professional contacts, 
as we have been building throughout our lives in different environments and most of us know who to turn to. 
As an immigrant your contact list is almost empty.</p>

<p>To build your network, you will need to actively meet new people.
Work, social media, professional events, group activities & hobbies, volunteering, courses,â€¦
Changing your life provokes reflection on various aspects, both personal and professional, and in a way provides 
a freedom of thought, which allows you to reinvent yourself.</p>
<p>I'm from Brazil - Rio de Janeiro. I'm an architect and in the last few years I had a store of decorative products and children's clothing. 
The universe of entrepreneurship captivated me and so I developed my skills to manage a business.
Upon arriving in Israel, at a certain moment I met QA and I was enchanted with this profession.
 I found a new area that makes the eye shine and that moves an excitement and a thirst for new knowledge.
